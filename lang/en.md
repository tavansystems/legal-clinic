URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/education/suspensions/learning-while-suspended](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/education/suspensions/learning-while-suspended)

Yes. Students can be suspended for a period of one to 20 school days. Students who are suspended for more than five school days are considered to be on a long-term suspension.  - Students who are suspended for one to five school days are expected to receive a homework package from the school.

- Students who are suspended for six to 10 school days must be offered an academic program that will help them continue learning. Students are encouraged to participate in the program.
- Students who are suspended for 11 to 20 school days must be offered a program with an academic component as well as a non-academic component to promote positive behaviour. Non-academic components could include supports like anger management, substance-abuse counselling or life skills coaching to help engage and motivate the student, and encourage positive behaviour. Students are encouraged to participate in the program.

#### What is Expulsion?

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/education/expulsion/expulsion](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/education/expulsion/expulsion)

An expulsion is different from a suspension. An expulsion does not have a time limit. Expelled students are removed from school for an indefinite time period. Students are suspended first, while expulsion is being considered. Students can be expelled from their own school or they can be expelled from all schools in their school board. Students expelled from all schools in their school board cannot go to school or take part in regular school activities or events. For example, expelled students cannot go on field trips or take part in school team events.

#### What happens after the principal's investigation?

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/education/expulsion/expulsion-investigation](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/education/expulsion/expulsion-investigation)

Following the investigation, the principal will:

a. Decide if the student should not be recommended for expulsion. In this case, the principal has three choices: 1. Confirm the suspension and its length. 2. Confirm the student is still suspended, but shorten the length of the suspension and update the student 's record. 3. Withdraw the suspension and remove it from the student 's record even if the suspension has already been served.

OR

b. Submit a report to the school board summarizing the principal 's findings and recommending that the student be expelled from their school only, or from all schools in the school board. The report is also sent to the student 's parents. If the principal recommends an expulsion, the school board will then hold an expulsion hearing. This must happen within 20 school days of the student being suspended.

### Can my children attend school if they are not citizens?

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/education/noncitizen-enrollment](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/education/noncitizen-enrollement)

Children who are non-citizens have the right to be in school as outlined  in the Education Act and the Code. The Education Act says that any pupil who lives in Ontario has a right to go to school. They have this right even if their parents are not Canadian or do not have legal status in Canada.

There are only very specific times when a school board can tell you that you cannot come to school. This includes times when you have been suspended, expelled or excluded. However, even if a school does this, your parents have the right to appeal this decision and should do so if the decision is unfair. You should speak with a lawyer about this.  - [https://archdisabilitylaw.ca/resource/guide-human-rights-and-education-in-ontario-a-general-guide-for-students/](https://archdisabilitylaw.ca/resource/guide-human-rights-and-education-in-ontario-a-general-guide-for-students/)

### What are some examples of discrimination in housing?

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/discrimination-examples](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/discrimination-examples)

Discrimination may occur if you are treated unfairly because of your: - race, colour, or ethnic background

- citizenship or the [country you are from](https://stepstojustice.ca/node/113087)
- religion
- age
- sex
- physical or mental disability, including an addiction
- marital status (for example, married, divorced, single, or living common-law)

or because you:

- are pregnant
- have children
- are caring for a relative

### What if another person who lives or works in the building discriminates against me?

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/discrimination](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/discrimination)

This law bans discrimination by landlords or people working for them. It also means your landlord must try to do something about it if you are being discriminated against by other tenants.

Sources:

### What if the discrimination I experience is not obvious?

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/obscure-discrimination](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/obscure-discrimination)

The term for this is called 'indirect discrimination'. Indirect discrimination can happen when rules or actions affect different groups in different ways.

Examples:

- The building has no ramp at the main entrance -- this can discriminate against people who use wheelchairs.
- A landlord threatens to evict tenants because of noise complaints -- this can discriminate against people with children.
- A landlord won 't rent to people with no credit rating -- this can discriminate against tenants who are young or new to Canada.

### What are my rights as a tenant if I have a disability?

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/disability-rights](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/disability-rights)

Ontario 's Human Rights Code says that if a tenant has a disability, landlords must try to "accommodate" their disability.

Accommodating your disability means doing whatever is needed to give you equal access. This means landlords must take away barriers for people with disabilities. They might have to make physical changes to the building, or they might have to change their rules or practices.

In most cases, landlords have a duty to accommodate you unless they can prove undue hardship.

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/covid-eviction](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/covid-eviction)

Yes. The LTB is still holding eviction hearings during the pandemic. On January 13, 2021, the government made an order stopping the Sheriff’s office from evicting most tenants during the second covid-19 state of emergency. This "eviction freeze" has now ended.

Your landlord can now have the Sheriff enforce eviction orders. It doesn't matter if the eviction order was made before or after the January 2021 eviction freeze. The Sheriff can evict you and have the locks changed.

Landlords can't evict you themselves. This means they can't change the locks and they can't get someone else, like the police to evict you. There is a process that landlords have to follow.

* Call the [Rental Housing Enforcement Unit](https://stepstojustice.ca/node/111465) (RHEU) at 1-888-772-9277 (toll-free) or 416-585-7214. The RHEU can contact your landlord to discuss the situation. They might be able to get your landlord to stop, or to let you back in if you've already been evicted illegally.
* Call your [local community legal clinic](https://stepstojustice.ca/links/find-legal-clinic) and tell them what is happening. You can speak to a lawyer or legal worker for free. They might be able to contact your landlord or make an urgent application to the Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB). It's best to get legal help if you want to go to the LTB. [Their physical offices are closed](https://stepstojustice.ca/links/renting-changes-during-covid-19-coronavirus) during the COVID-19 emergency and they are only accepting certain types of applications.
* If you can't get legal help, you can make an urgent application to the LTB using their [online Form T2](https://stepstojustice.ca/links/ltb-e-file-1). There is a $45 filing fee which you will have to pay by credit card or debit card.
* Call the police non-emergency number. Sometimes police officers won't get involved in this kind of situation. But many police forces are aware of the danger of illegal evictions during the COVID-19 crisis.

### What normally happens during an eviction?

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/what-happens-during-eviction](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/what-happens-during-eviction)

When tenants owe rent, [landlords can give them a notice](https://stepstojustice.ca/questions/housing-law/what-can-happen-if-i-dont-pay-my-rent-time).

If the tenant does not pay within 14 days, or within 7 days if it's a weekly tenancy, the landlord can apply to the Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) for an eviction order. But during the COVID-19 emergency, the LTB is not scheduling eviction hearings for rent arrears, and Sheriff's offices are not doing evictions for rent arrears.

### Can my landlord increase my rent during the pandemic?

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/covid-rent-inscrease](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/covid-rent-inscrease)

No, there is currently a rent freeze in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Otherwize as long as the rent increase is legal, it can still go ahead.

Your rent increase is probably legal if:

- your landlord gave you written notice at least 90 days before the date of the increase - the notice is properly filled out on the Landlord and Tenant Board's Form N1
- the date of the increase is at least 12 months after your last rent increase
- the amount of the increase is less than or equal to the provincial guideline for the year (2.2 % for 2020)

But if your unit was never occupied for residential purposes on or before November 15, 2018, your landlord doesn't have to follow the guideline. In that situation, landlords can raise the rent by any amount, as long as they follow the other rules mentioned above and they use a Form N2.

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/covid-repair-refusal](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/covid-repair-refusal)

Landlords are [responsible for repairs and maintenance](https://stepstojustice.ca/legal-topic/housing-law/repairs-maintenance) of your unit and any common areas of the building, except for damage caused by you or your guests. This hasn't changed because of the COVID-19 emergency.

### Does my landlord have rights to show my place to prospective tenants?

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/apartment-viewing](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/aparment-viewing)

Yes, your landlord normally has some rights to show your place if they give you proper notice. The time they are coming in must be between 8 am and 8 pm. You can agree to a different time, but you don't have to. To show your place to a possible buyer, insurer, or mortgage lender, your landlord must give you notice in writing at least 24 hours ahead of time.

Your landlord can show your place to a possible tenant only if:

- you have given notice to move out,
- your landlord has given you a notice to move out, or
- you and your landlord have agreed that you will move out.

In these situations, the landlord doesn't have to give you a written notice, but they must make a reasonable effort to let you know when they are coming.

## What if the LTB grants an eviction against me?

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/ltb-ruling](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/housing/ltb-ruling)

If the Board ordered your eviction, you have 72 hours to take your belongings after the Sheriff comes and the locks get changed. During those 72 hours, your landlord must keep your things in or near your place, and let you get them any time between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. But, if you move out before the locks are changed, the law is not clear about when you have to get your things out of your place.

If you move out:

- after giving notice to your landlord,
- because you got a Notice to End your Tenancy, or
- because you and your landlord agreed to end your tenancy.

Your landlord can sell, keep, give away, or throw out anything you leave behind.

### Visiting Canada

#### Can I help a friend or family member apply to visit Canada?

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/immigration/visiting/help-friend](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/immigration/visiting/help-friend)

Anyone who wants to visit Canada must apply from outside of Canada before they travel. What your friend or family member needs depends on the:

- type of travel document they will travel with;
- country that issued their travel document;
- their nationality; and
- how they will travel to Canada (sea, air, or land).

Often, a 'visitor visa' isrequired, which is a document allowing entry into Canada. A letter of invitation or document inviting a person into Canada with reasons, can help with a visa application but it is not a guarantee that a visa will be issued, and entry allowed.

#### How long can I stay in Canada as a visitor?

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/immigration/visiting/visitor-stay](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/immigration/visiting/visitor-stay)

Generally, you can stay in Canada for up to 6 months as a visitor. When you arrive in Canada, a border officer may allow you to stay for more or less than 6 months at their discretion. If this happens, the border officer will usually put the date you must leave by in your passport. If a border officer does not put a date in your passport,you can stay for 6 months from the day you entered Canada or until your passport expires, whichever happens first. If you decide to stay longer, you should apply for an extension at least 30 days before the original end of your stay that was approved when you arrived in Canada.

#### What if my visitor visa is denied?

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/immigration/visiting/visitor-visa-denied](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/immigration/visiting/visitor-visa-denined)

If your application for a visitor visa was denied, then you should not apply again with the same exact information. Even if you apply with the help of an immigration or travel agent, but the information is the same, then the decision will not be changed. Your application may be refused because: - It is believed you will stay in Canada beyond your authorized stay; or

* You are found inadmissible to Canada.

You can be found inadmissible to Canada for many reasons, including security reasons, committing a crime, medical reasons, financial reasons, or because you misrepresented information.

If your situation changes,then you can reapply, and your application may provide a different result. For example,you can reapply if you were inadmissible for medical reasons, but your medical condition changed.

* Are a Canadian citizen who lives abroad and
* plan to return to Canada when your relatives immigrate and

are sponsoring your spouse or common-law or conjugal partner or dependent children with no dependent children of their own.

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/employment/worker-rights/fire-rights/firing-notice](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/empolyment/worker-rights/fire-rights/firing-notice)

For notices of termination, there are minimum notice periods ranging from 1 week, for those who worked at least 3 months, to 8 weeks, for people who worked for 8 years or more with the same employer. Usually, people are given more than these minimum notice periods because the court will look to see what is 'reasonable' in the circumstances. Usually, more than the minimum notice periods are required when:

* Working for an employer for a long time
* Having a specialized job
* Difficulty finding similar work
* Being older

You may also be fired without notice if you did not work continuously for at least 3 months with your employer. Even if you did something wrong, your employer may not fire you without notice if:

* Your actions were not serious,
* You were not given an opportunity to correct the action, or
* You were employed with the employer for a long time.

Your employer is not required to give reasons for firing or laying you off but must give you a written notice of termination in many situations. A written 'notice of termination' can take one of two forms:

1. The employer tells you in advance.
2. The employer tells you immediately and must pay you 'termination pay' or money you would have earned if you were given notice in advance.

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/employment/employment-insurance/ei-benefits](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/empolyment/employment-insurance/ei-benefits)

#### Can my employer make deductions from my wages?

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/employment/compensation/wage-deductions](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/empolyment/compensation/wage-deductions)

Yes, your employer can make deductions from your wages. There are 3 types of deductions your employer can make:

* Statutory deductions for income tax, Employment Insurance, and Canada Pension Plan.
* Court orders for unpaid third parties.
* Written Authorization, where you signed a document allowing your employer to deduct a specific amount. Your employer cannot deduct from your wages for faulty work or because your employer had a shortage of money.

On or before your payday,the employer must give you a 'wage statement', in writing, setting out pay details, such as the pay period, wage rate, amount and purpose of deductions, and other information. This information must be kept separate from cheques so that it is not taken away when cashing a cheque.

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/empolyment/compensation/employer-debt](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/empolyment/compensation/employer-debt)

Employers must establish a regular pay period and a regular pay day for employees. Your employer must pay your wages, including vacation pay, by the later of:

* 7 days after your employment ends
* Your next regular payday

If you earn commission or bonuses, look to your employment contract or normal practice. Most bonuses are not paid until the goods or services are delivered to the customer and payment is received.

#### Must my employer pay me overtime?

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/employment/compensation/overtime](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/empolyment/compensation/overtime)

It depends on the situation. Usually, overtime begins after you worked more than 44 hours a week. After 44 hours, you must be paid 'overtime pay' which is 1½ times your regular rate of pay. For example, an employee paid $14 an hour will have an overtime rate of $21 an hour (14 × 1.5 = 21).

#### How many breaks can I get at work?

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/employment/hours-of-work/breaks](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/empolyment/hours-of-work/breaks)

Generally, you get at least 30 minutes of break for every 5 hours worked. Your employer is not required to pay you during this break unless your employment agreement requires payment. If you and your employer agree verbally or in writing, instead of a 30-minute break, you may have 2 separate breaks, each being 15 minutes. Meal breaks are not considered hours of work and are not included in overtime hours whether paid or unpaid.

## Criminal Law

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/criminal-law](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/criminal-law)

The Criminal Code is the law that lays out criminal offences in Canada. Parliament creates the laws and police officers enforce the laws. When dealing with the police, you are entitled to certain rights and procedures. Individual rights on arrest and detention are laid out in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (CCRF). These provisions of the CCRF apply to individuals physically inside of Canada. This includes immigrants and permanent residents.

The police may only detain someone if they believe that the person committed a criminal offence. You can ask a police officer if you are being detained. If you are not free to leave, then you are being detained. When you are detained you have the right to know why. There are different rules on how and where a police officer can stop you. For example, if you are in a vehicle you must always stop for the police. In other situations, the police may or may not have the legal right to stop you. It is always a good idea to talk to a lawyer to find out whether you were lawfully stopped or detained.

If you are arrested, you have rights. You must be told that you are under arrest. When you are under arrest, you have the right to remain silent and you have the right to seek a lawyer. While you have the right to remain silent, the police officers can still ask you questions but you do not have to answer them. If you choose to remain silent, the court cannot hold that against you. However, if you are involved in a motor vehicle accident you must give a statement to the police officer. Once you reach the station the police officers have to arrange for you to contact a lawyer. The police may decide to release you, or you may attend court for a bail hearing. Typically, the police need to get you in front of a judge for a bail hearing within 24 hours or as soon as possible.

The Police have search powers, but they have rules they must follow. The police can search you if they get a search warrant (permission) from a judge. The police can search you incident to arrest or conduct a safety search to ensure you do not have any weapons or anything that can harm them. You can also be searched if you give the police permission to search you. Once you are arrested the police can conduct a more thorough search.

There are different rules for the police arresting minors between the age of 12-17. Information on police procedure for minors is contained in the Youth Criminal Justice Act. For example, there are different rules on questioning minors.

### Marriage

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/family-law/marriage](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/family-law/marriage)

To be legally married in Canada you must be 18 years old. You may marry at age 16 or 17 with written permission from your parents or guardians. However, anyone under 16 may not be legally married. Your marriage will not be legally valid if you or your spouse is married to more than one person. Polygamy is illegal in Canada. If you are divorced outside of Canada, you need to prove that your divorce is legal in that country. A forced marriage is not legal. If you are married in Ontario, you must get a marriage licence. If you want to get married in another province you must follow the marriage rules for that province. For example, a legally valid marriage ceremony must be conducted by someone licensed to do so. You must find an imam who is licensed to do so. When in doubt, seek legal advice.

### Divorce

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/family-law/divorce](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/family-law/divorce)

The Divorce Act contains the legal rules on divorce in Canada. If you wish to get divorced, you must apply for a divorce. You do not need anyone’s permission to do so. If you obtain a religious divorce it does not mean that you are legally divorced in Canada. The only way to get legally divorced in Canada is to go through the process set out in the Divorce Act. You can also ask the court to decide custody and support (financial support for the children or yourself from your ex-spouse). To better understand this process, obtain legal advice from a lawyer or community legal clinic.

Ontario accepts divorces from other countries if you or your spouse lived in that country for at least one year before you applied for a divorce. If you have not you may still be able to get your divorce accepted in Ontario. Seek legal assistance in doing so. Some countries allow divorce bidah (innovated divorce). It is unlikely that a Canadian court would recognize this form of divorce.

## Human Rights Laws

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/human-rights-law](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/human-rights-law)

Everyone must be given equal rights and opportunities without discrimination in many areas, such as employment, housing, services, facilities, and contracts or agreements.

Discrimination may occur based on one or more of the following:

* your race, colour, ancestry, ethnic origin, citizenship, or where you were born
* your religious beliefs
* a physical or mental disability, including an addiction
* having children, planning to have children, or being pregnant
* your marital status, for example, married, divorced, single, or living common-law
* your sex or gender
* your sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression
* your age if you are at least 18
* being convicted of a crime if you have a pardon or record suspension

In addition to the Ontario Human Rights Commission, which provides research, education, and policy development, there is also the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario where human rights applications are filed and heard.

If you are experiencing discrimination in the workplace, your employer must take steps to stop this from continuing otherwise they could be held liable by the Human Rights Commission of Ontario. You must immediately make a complaint to your employer and if they refuse to take action, then you may bring a human rights complaint to have the matter addressed. You can make a claim with the Human Rights Tribunal online at http://www.sjto.gov.on.ca/hrto/.

In employment matters, if the Human Rights Commission finds that you were discriminated against, they can provide many remedies including:

* Order the employer to hire you
* Require the employer to compensate you
* Order the employer to remove a person who discriminated against you
* Require your employer to undergo discrimination awareness training
* Offer you your job back if it was lost

If you are experiencing discrimination in any other areas, such as in the service industry, you may also bring a claim with the Human Rights Tribunal in order to access remedies. Other general remedies that you may be granted include:

* Money
* Non-monetary award (human rights training, building an accessible entrance for those who discriminated)
* Order to promote future compliance (develop human rights policies, training)

Keep in mind that you must file your application within 1 year of when the discrimination happened. If you were discriminated against more than once, you must file the application within 1 year of the last event. There are exceptions for late applications if the delay occurred in good faith and does not cause substantial harm (prejudice) to others involved. For more information on Ontario Human Rights, please reach out to the Muslim Ottawa Legal Services division.

## Refugee Law

URL: [https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/refugee-law](https://legal-clinic.mfso.ca/#/en/refugee-law)

In order to come to Canada as a refugee, you can apply for refugee protection inside Canada as a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection OR you must be referred by a private sponsorship group or a designated referral organization, such as the United Nations Refugee Agency. Generally, for an organization or private group to refer you, you must fall into one of the following classes:

1. Convention refugee abroad class

To fall within this class, you:

* are outside your home country,
* cannot return to your home country due to a well-founded fear of persecution based on
* race
* religion
* political opinion
* nationality, or
* membership in a particular social group. Examples: gender, sexual orientation, etc.

2. Country of asylum class

To fall within this class, you:

* are outside your home country, or the country where you normally live, and
* are seriously affected by civil war or armed conflict, or
* are denied basic human rights on a regular basis.

You are not eligible to apply as a refugee to Canada if:

* You have another suitable option for protection, such as an offer to be resettled in another country,
* You have become a citizen of another country, who will protect you,
* You choose to return to the country you left, or
* The reasons you left your country no longer exist, such as conflict ending or peace status.

Many companies, organizations, or groups may require you to pay a fee for them to refer you to Canada as a refugee, but please note that you are not required to pay anyone for a referral. Do not allow anyone to trick you into paying a fee in exchange for a referral service. There are no guarantees that you will be accepted to Canada as a refugee regardless of how much you pay towards the processing of your application. For more information, please reach out to the Muslim Ottawa Legal Services division.
