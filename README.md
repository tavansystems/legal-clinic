# Multilingual Online Legal Clinic

The multilingual online legal clinic is an online initiative commissioned and organized by [Muslim Family Services of Ottawa](https://mfso.ca), developed and integrated by [Tavan Systems Inc.](https://tavansystems.com) and supported by [The Law Foundation of Ontario](https://lawfoundation.on.ca/). This online multilingual legal resource hub will be an invaluable resource for the Ottawa community, due to the ongoing lack of linguistically appropriate materials on everyday legal matters.
