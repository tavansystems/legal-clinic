Parliament creates the laws and police officers enforce the laws. When dealing with the police, you are entitled to certain rights and procedures. Individual rights on arrest and detention are laid out in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (CCRF). These provisions of the CCRF apply to individuals physically inside of Canada. This includes immigrants and permanent residents.\\n\\nThe police may only detain someone if they believe that the person committed a criminal offence. You can ask a police officer if you are being detained. If you are not free to leave, then you are being detained. When you are detained you have the right to know why. There are different rules on how and where a police officer can stop you. For example, if you are in a vehicle you must always stop for the police. In other situations, the police may or may not have the legal right to stop you. It is always a good idea to talk to a lawyer to find out whether you were lawfully stopped or detained.\\n\\nIf you are arrested, you have rights. You must be told that you are under arrest. When you are under arrest, you have the right to remain silent and you have the right to seek a lawyer. While you have the right to remain silent, the police officers can still ask you questions but you do not have to answer them. If you choose to remain silent, the court cannot hold that against you. However, if you are involved in a motor vehicle accident you must give a statement to the police officer. Once you reach the station the police officers have to arrange for you to contact a lawyer. The police may decide to release you, or you may attend court for a bail hearing. Typically, the police need to get you in front of a judge for a bail hearing within 24 hours or as soon as possible.\\n\\nThe Police have search powers, but they have rules they must follow. The police can search you if they get a search warrant (permission) from a judge. The police can search you incident to arrest or conduct a safety search to ensure you do not have any weapons or anything that can harm them. You can also be searched if you give the police permission to search you. Once you are arrested the police can conduct a more thorough search.\\n\\nThere are different rules for the police arresting minors between the age of 12-17. Information on police procedure for minors is contained in the Youth Criminal Justice Act. For example, there are different rules on questioning minors.\\n\\nFor more information contact a lawyer, your local community legal clinic,and/or the following links:\\n\\n* Justice For Children & Youth Rights Wiki:\\n* Steps to Justice: [https://stepstojustice.ca/](https://stepstojustice.ca/)\\n* Community Legal Education Ontario: [https://www.cleo.on.ca](https://www.cleo.on.ca)\\n\\nSources:\\n\\n* [https://stepstojustice.ca/legal-topic/criminal-law](https://stepstojustice.ca/legal-topic/criminal-law)\\n","options":{},"sources":["https://stepstojustice.ca/legal-topic/criminal-law"]},"family-law":{"title":"Family Law","options":{"marriage":{"title":"Marriage","content":"\\n\\nTo be legally married in Canada you must be 18 years old. You may marry at age 16 or 17 with written permission from your parents or guardians. However, anyone under 16 may not be legally married. Your marriage will not be legally valid if you or your spouse is married to more than one person. Polygamy is illegal in Canada. If you are divorced outside of Canada, you need to prove that your divorce is legal in that country. A forced marriage is not legal. If you are married in Ontario, you must get a marriage licence. If you want to get married in another province you must follow the marriage rules for that province. For example, a legally valid marriage ceremony must be conducted by someone licensed to do so. You must find an imam who is licensed to do so.

If you wish to get divorced, you must apply for a divorce. You do not need anyone\u2019s permission to do so. If you obtain a religious divorce it does not mean that you are legally divorced in Canada. The only way to get legally divorced in Canada is to go through the process set out in the Divorce Act. You can also ask the court to decide custody and support (financial support for the children or yourself from your ex-spouse). To better understand this process, obtain legal advice from a lawyer or community legal clinic.\\n\\nOntario accepts divorces from other countries if you or your spouse lived in that country for at least one year before you applied for a divorce. If you have not you may still be able to get your divorce accepted in Ontario. Seek legal assistance in doing so. Some countries allow divorce bidah (innovated divorce).
