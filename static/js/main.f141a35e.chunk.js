Bunge linatengeneza sheria na maafisa wa polisi wanazitekeleza sheria hizo. Unapokamatwa na polisi, unastaili baadhi ya haki na taratibu. Haki binafsi wakati wa kuwekwa chini ya ulinzi na kuzuiwa zinaelezewa katika Hati ya Haki na Uhuru ya Kanada au Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (CCRF). Vifungu hivi vya CCRF vinawahusu watu waliopo ndani ya Kanada. Hii ni pamoja na wakimbizi na wakazi wa kudumu.\\n\\nPolisi wanaruhusiwa kumzuia mtu ikiwa tu kama wanaamini kwamba mtu huyo ametenda kosa la jinai. Unaweza kumuuliza polisi kama amekuzuia. Kama hauko huru kuondoka, basi amekuzuia. Unapokuwa umezuiwa una haki ya kujua ni kwanini. Kuna sheria tatu za namna na wapi polisi anaweza kukusimamisha. Kwa mfano, kama uko ndani ya gari ni lazima mara zote usimame unaposimamiswa na polisi. Katika hali zingine, polisi anaweza akawa au asiwe na haki kisheria ya kukusimamisha. Mara zote ni jambo zuri kuongea na mwanasheria ili kujua kama ulisimamishwa au kuzuiwa kwa usahihi kisheria.\\n\\nKama ukiwekwa chini ya ulinzi, unazo haki zako. Ni lazima uambiwe kwamba uko chini ya ulinzi. Unapokuwa chini ya ulinzi, una haki ya kukaa kimya na una haki ya kutafuta mwana sheria. Japokuwa una haki ya kukaa kimya, afisa wa polisi bado anaweza kuendelea kukuuliza maswali lakini sio lazima uyajibu. Kama ukiamua kubaki kimya, mahakama haiwezi kutumia hilo dhidi yako. Hata hivyo, kama ulihusika katika ajali ya chombo cha moto ni lazima utoe maelezo kwa afisa wa polisi. Baada ya kufika kituo cha polisi basi askari polisi wanatakiwa kukufanyia mpango wa wewe kuwasiliana na mwanasheria. Polisi wanaweza kuamua kukuachia, au unaweza kufika mahakamani kwa ajili ya kusikiliza kesi ya dhamana. Kwa kawaida, polisi wanahitaji kukufikisha mbele ya jaji kwa ajili ya kusikiliza kesi ya dhamana ndani ya masaa 24 au haraka iwezekanavyo.\\n\\nPolisi wana uwezo wa kukukagua, lakini wana sheria ya kufuata inayowaongoza. Polisi wanaweza kukukagua kama wakipata hati yaupekuzi (ruhusa) kutoka kwa jaji. Polisi wanaweza kukukagua baada ya kukuweka chini ya ulinzi au kufanya ukaguzi kuhakikisha hauna silaha au kitu chochote cha kuwadhuru. Unaweza pia kupekuliwa kama ukiwapa polisi ruhusa ya kukupekua. Baada ya kuwekwa chini ya ulinzi polisi wanaweza kufanya ukaguzi wa kina zaidi.\\n\\nKuna sheria mbalimbali za polisi wanapomuweka chini ya ulinzi mtoto kati ya umri wa miaka 12-17. Taarifa za juu ya taratibu za polisi kumuweka chini ya ulinzi mtoto zinapatikana katika Sheria ya Haki za Jinai kwa Vijana (Youth Criminal Justice Act).

Individual rights on arrest and detention are laid out in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (CCRF). These provisions of the CCRF apply to individuals physically inside of Canada. This includes immigrants and permanent residents.\\n\\nThe police may only detain someone if they believe that the person committed a criminal offence. You can ask a police officer if you are being detained. If you are not free to leave, then you are being detained. When you are detained you have the right to know why. There are different rules on how and where a police officer can stop you. For example, if you are in a vehicle you must always stop for the police. In other situations, the police may or may not have the legal right to stop you. It is always a good idea to talk to a lawyer to find out whether you were lawfully stopped or detained.\\n\\nIf you are arrested, you have rights. You must be told that you are under arrest. When you are under arrest, you have the right to remain silent and you have the right to seek a lawyer. While you have the right to remain silent, the police officers can still ask you questions but you do not have to answer them. If you choose to remain silent, the court cannot hold that against you. However, if you are involved in a motor vehicle accident you must give a statement to the police officer. Once you reach the station the police officers have to arrange for you to contact a lawyer. The police may decide to release you, or you may attend court for a bail hearing. Typically, the police need to get you in front of a judge for a bail hearing within 24 hours or as soon as possible.\\n\\nThe Police have search powers, but they have rules they must follow. The police can search you if they get a search warrant (permission) from a judge. The police can search you incident to arrest or conduct a safety search to ensure you do not have any weapons or anything that can harm them. You can also be searched if you give the police permission to search you. Once you are arrested the police can conduct a more thorough search.\\n\\nThere are different rules for the police arresting minors between the age of 12-17.
